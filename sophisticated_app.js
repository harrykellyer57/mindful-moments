Here's a complex and sophisticated JavaScript code example that goes beyond a simple "hello world" or calculator. This code is a fictional application called "SophisticatedApp" which simulates a weather forecasting system:

```javascript
// sophisticated_app.js - Sophisticated Weather Forecasting System

// Map containing the weather conditions for various cities
const cityWeatherConditions = new Map();

// Function to add weather conditions for a given city
const addCityWeather = (city, temp, humidity, wind) => {
  cityWeatherConditions.set(city, { temperature: temp, humidity, wind });
};

// Function to get the weather conditions for a given city
const getCityWeather = (city) => {
  return cityWeatherConditions.get(city);
};

// Class representing a Weather Forecast
class WeatherForecast {
  constructor(city, days) {
    this.city = city;
    this.days = days;
    this.forecast = [];
  }

  generateForecast() {
    for (let i = 0; i < this.days; i++) {
      const temperature = Math.floor(Math.random() * 30) + 1;
      const humidity = Math.floor(Math.random() * 100) + 1;
      const wind = Math.floor(Math.random() * 50) + 1;
      this.forecast.push({ day: i + 1, temperature, humidity, wind });
    }
  }

  printForecast() {
    console.log(`Weather Forecast for ${this.city}:`);
    this.forecast.forEach((day) => {
      console.log(
        `Day ${day.day}: Temperature - ${day.temperature}Â°C, Humidity - ${day.humidity}%, Wind - ${day.wind}mph`
      );
    });
  }
}

// Usage example
addCityWeather("New York", 22, 45, 12);
addCityWeather("London", 15, 68, 9);
addCityWeather("Tokyo", 28, 85, 7);

const nycForecast = new WeatherForecast("New York", 5);
nycForecast.generateForecast();
nycForecast.printForecast();
```

In this code, a fictional weather forecasting system is implemented with the ability to add weather conditions for various cities, generate weather forecasts for a specific number of days, and display the forecasts. It uses functional and object-oriented programming concepts, including map data structure, classes, and methods.

Please note that this is a fictional example and the weather conditions are randomly generated for demonstration purposes. In a real-world scenario, weather data would be obtained from external APIs or other sources.
